## So whats this?
This is my attempt at Ludum Dare 36 Jam which had the theme "Ancient Technology", a game where you'd be a professor in archeology, exploring an
ancient civilizations abandoned temple ruins (... or are they?), while trying to find a way to escape using the technology found in the ruins.

It was not finished, more time was required which is partly due to my inexperience, it being my first gamejam, but it was a lot of fun, along the way learning how to use Aseprite, Tiled, getting to know LÖVE better (had used it before, but not for any substantial project).
The code is probably the greatest abomination I have ever produced, so look at it at your own peril.

There is no audio, I considered it out of scope.. :D

## Built With
